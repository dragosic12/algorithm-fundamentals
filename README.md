# Algorithm Fundamentals

This repository contains exercises and examples used to practice and reinforce the concepts learned in the **Algorithm Fundamentals** course. Throughout this course, I have acquired knowledge in the following areas:

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Algorithm Concepts**
   - Understanding of time and space complexity (Big O notation)
   - Algorithm efficiency and optimization techniques

2. **Iterative Algorithms**
   - Development and implementation of loops to solve problems
   - Use of iterative structures in algorithms for tasks like searching, sorting, and traversing

3. **Recursion**
   - Understanding the principles of recursion
   - Designing recursive algorithms to solve problems
   - Comparison between recursive and iterative approaches

4. **Backtracking**
   - Learning the concept of backtracking for solving complex problems
   - Application in problems such as combinatorial optimization and puzzles (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku)

5. **Divide and Conquer**
   - Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems
   - Mastering classic algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search

6. **Greedy Algorithms (Optional)**
   - Understanding the greedy approach to problem-solving
   - Applying greedy methods in problems such as activity selection and coin change

7. **Dynamic Programming (Optional)**
   - Introduction to dynamic programming techniques for solving optimization problems
   - Learning to store intermediate results to improve efficiency in problems like the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem

## Repository Structure

- The repository is organized into folders corresponding to different algorithmic paradigms (e.g., iterative, recursive, backtracking, divide-and-conquer).
- Each folder contains exercises and examples that were used to practice and master these concepts.
- The code examples are written in [specify the programming language you're using, e.g., Python, Java, etc.].

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for reviewing the algorithms learned throughout the course. It contains all the exercises and solutions that were completed as part of the **Algorithm Fundamentals** class, allowing further study and exploration of each concept.

Feel free to explore the repository and use it as a reference for studying and implementing these fundamental algorithmic concepts.
